# T9-Pedal-Bundle
An Arduino-compatible software bundle using the Teensy Audio library for controlling effects in the T9 pedal.
  
Available effects are accessible through a pointer array with attributes for the effect and parameter names, and functions for parameter changes and connecting and disconnecting that effect.
